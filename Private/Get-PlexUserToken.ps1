				username             : their-username
				thumb                : https://plex.tv/users/jkh324jkh234jh23/avatar?c=4353453454
				title                : their-email@domain.com

			Despite the singular example, the data can vary depending on how the user signed up.
			We may find that title/username is a typical username.
			We may find that title/username is the same as the email.
			We may find that for a managed user, they won't have a username or email but only 'title'.
			
				title                       username                email
				-----                       --------                -----
				mycleverusername            mycleverusername        someperson@hotmail.com
				anotheruser@gmail.com       anotheruser@gmail.com   anotheruser@gmail.com 
				manageduser

			In order to cater to managed users, we will effectively use the title, as username.
			
			Note: It's entirely possible that there could be a managed user with the same username
			as a normal user. It's unlikely, but possible. This should be handled by downstream code.
